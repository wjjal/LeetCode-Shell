Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the ' ' character.

For example, if file.txt has the following content:

name age
alice 21
ryan 30
Output the following:

name alice ryan
age 21 30

Solution:
awk '
{ 
   for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){
      a[NR,i]=$i
   }
} 
END{
    for(j=1;j<=NF;j++){
       str=a[1,j]
       for(i=2;i<=NR;i++){
          str=str" "a[i,j]
       } 
       print str
    }
}' file.txt
